## Challenge Overview 
I came into this bootcamp with a little bit of knowledge on Java Script. In one way, I was grateful because it made me familiar with loops, if statements, and indexes. However, the way the variables are called and defined are different and sometimes backwards. It took some time and effort to get used to that. 

Using Visual Studio Code was a challenge in it of itself as well. Watching the professors it during the live class helped. Also, many thanks to the TA’s who walked me through the program. 

Overall, even though this challenge had it’s ups and down but I feel like I got a good grasp on it in the end. 

## Summary 
The analysis provided is quite succinct. We got a look at all the candidates, their votes, their percentage of the total votes, and a specified overview of the winner’s vote count.
 
Although more data can be provided, it is not necessary.
